        The Indian ODI team in the early 2000s saw Rahul Dravid as the wicket-keeper to ensure that 
        the wicket-keeper spot didn't lack in batting talent and also tried other wicket-keeper/batsmen like Parthiv Patel and Dinesh Karthik.[36]
         With Dhoni performing well for the India A squad, he was picked in the ODI squad for the Bangladesh tour in December 2004.[37] Dhoni made his 
         debut in the first match of the series and was run out for a duck.[38] Dhoni was picked for the subsequent ODI series against Pakistan.[39] In
          the second match of the series in Visakhapatnam, Dhoni playing in his fifth one-day international, scored 148 runs off 123
           deliveries which surpassed the earlier record for the highest score by an Indian wicket-keeper.[40]
            Dhoni played in the Sri Lankan bilateral ODI series in October–November 2005 and was promoted to No. 3 
            in the batting order in the third ODI at Jaipur where he scored an unbeaten 183 runs off 145 balls,
             winning the game for India.[41] The innings would surpass his earlier record for the highest score by an Indian wicket-keeper and 
             was described in Wisden Almanack as 'Uninhibited, yet anything but crude'.[42] It was also the highest individual score in ODI cricket in a run chase, 
             a record which was broken seven years later by Shane Watson.[43][44] Dhoni ended the series with the highest aggregate of 346 runs and was awarded the Man of the series.[45]

                 Dhoni dropped multiple catches and missed dismissal chances including a key stumping opportunity of Andrew Flintoff which led to criticism of his wicket-keeping.[53]

I               n the DLF Cup 2006-07, Dhoni scored 43 runs as the team lost twice in three games and 
                did not qualify for the finals. In the 2006 ICC Champions Trophy, India lost to West Indies and Australia, 
                though Dhoni scored a half-century against West Indies and failed to make it to the knock out stage.[54] In the
                     ODI series in South Africa in November 2006, Dhoni scored 139 runs in four matches in the series loss.[46]
                    In the test series that followed, Dhoni scored 114 runs in two tests including 
                        a first test victory in South Africa in the first test, but was ruled out of the third test with injury.[55]
                     Dhoni made his T20 international debut in December 2006 against South Africa at Johannesburg.[56] 
                        Dhoni was subsequently named in the ODI team of the year by the ICC for 2006.[57]
                        The Indian ODI team in the early 2000s saw Rahul Dravid as the wicket-keeper to ensure that 
        the wicket-keeper spot didn't lack in batting talent and also tried other wicket-keeper/batsmen like Parthiv Patel and Dinesh Karthik.[36]
         With Dhoni performing well for the India A squad, he was picked in the ODI squad for the Bangladesh tour in December 2004.[37] Dhoni made his 
         debut in the first match of the series and was run out for a duck.[38] Dhoni was picked for the subsequent ODI series against Pakistan.[39] In
          the second match of the series in Visakhapatnam, Dhoni playing in his fifth one-day international, scored 148 runs off 123
           deliveries which surpassed the earlier record for the highest score by an Indian wicket-keeper.[40]
            Dhoni played in the Sri Lankan bilateral ODI series in October–November 2005 and was promoted to No. 3 
            in the batting order in the third ODI at Jaipur where he scored an unbeaten 183 runs off 145 balls,
             winning the game for India.[41] The innings would surpass his earlier record for the highest score by an Indian wicket-keeper and 
             was described in Wisden Almanack as 'Uninhibited, yet anything but crude'.[42] It was also the highest individual score in ODI cricket in a run chase, 
             a record which was broken seven years later by Shane Watson.[43][44] Dhoni ended the series with the highest aggregate of 346 runs and was awarded the Man of the series.[45]

            Dhoni became a regular in the Indian side after the home series against South Africa in November 2005.[46] In December 2005, Dhoni was awarded a "B" grade contract by the BCCI.[47]
            Dhoni made his test debut in the same month against Sri Lanka during their tour of India at Chennai.[48][49] Dhoni scored 30 runs in his debut match, that was marred by rain and ended in a draw.[50]
                Dhoni made his maiden half-century in the second test leading to an Indian win.[51] Dhoni played all the matches in the subsequent
                tour of Pakistan scoring 219 runs in five ODI matches and 179 runs in five tests including his maiden test century in the second test in Faisalabad.[52]
                He scored 106 runs across three tests in the home series against England in March 2006 and 177 runs in five ODI series that followed.[52][46]

The Indian ODI team in the early 2000s saw Rahul Dravid as the wicket-keeper to ensure that 
        the wicket-keeper spot didn't lack in batting talent and also tried other wicket-keeper/batsmen like Parthiv Patel and Dinesh Karthik.[36]
         With Dhoni performing well for the India A squad, he was picked in the ODI squad for the Bangladesh tour in December 2004.[37] Dhoni made his 
         debut in the first match of the series and was run out for a duck.[38] Dhoni was picked for the subsequent ODI series against Pakistan.[39] In
          the second match of the series in Visakhapatnam, Dhoni playing in his fifth one-day international, scored 148 runs off 123
           deliveries which surpassed the earlier record for the highest score by an Indian wicket-keeper.[40]
            Dhoni played in the Sri Lankan bilateral ODI series in October–November 2005 and was promoted to No. 3 
            in the batting order in the third ODI at Jaipur where he scored an unbeaten 183 runs off 145 balls,
             winning the game for India.[41] The innings would surpass his earlier record for the highest score by an Indian wicket-keeper and 
             was described in Wisden Almanack as 'Uninhibited, yet anything but crude'.[42] It was also the highest individual score in ODI cricket in a run chase, 
             a record which was broken seven years later by Shane Watson.[43][44] Dhoni ended the series with the highest aggregate of 346 runs and was awarded the Man of the series.[45]

                did not qualify for the finals. In the 2006 ICC Champions Trophy, India lost to West Indies and Australia,
